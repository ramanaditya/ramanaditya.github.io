## About MicroPython

**MicroPython** is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on micro-controllers and in constrained environments.

MicroPython is packed full of advanced features such as an interactive prompt, arbitrary precision integers, closures, list comprehension, generators, exception handling and more. Yet it is compact enough to fit and run within just 256k of code space and 16k of RAM.

The **ESP8266** chip is a great platform for using MicroPython.

## About NodeMCU

**NodeMCU** is an **open source IoT platform**. It includes firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from **Espressif** Systems, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module.

## Features of NodeMCU :

- **Arduino-like hardware IO** : Advanced API for hardware IO, which can dramatically reduce the redundant work for configuring and manipulating hardware. Code like arduino, but interactively.
- **Nodejs style network API** : Event-driven API for network applications, which facilitates developers writing code and running on a MCU in Nodejs style. This speeds up your IOT application developing process.
- **Lowest cost programmable WI-FI** : Less than $2 WI-FI MCU ESP8266 integrated and easy to prototyping development kit.
- **Wifi networking** (can be used as access point and/or station, host a web server), connect to internet to fetch or upload data.
